The switch line in parser cannot be covered since it is unreachable.
When I tried to put type that is not the four(String, boolean, integer, character),
The program would not be able to start.
The getBoolean line in parser cannot be covered since the value cannot suffice to reach all branches.
For example, The value cannot be false and 0 at the same time.

Same for the lines in equals function in option class,
the program would not run for some of branches so they cannot be reached.

In the optionmap class, (if option !=null) is unreachable inside the two functions.
Some other error takes place before this line reaches
when i tried to give an option that is null.

Above are unreable lines and My final result is 99.5% coverage.
