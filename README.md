# STCOURSEWORK2021-22

This part requires that you add source code to Parser.java in the src
folder to support the new specification. Check whether all the tests you
developed in Part 1 pass for your modified implementation. If they donâ€™t,
modify the implementation and/or tests so the entire test suite passes
and the new specification is implemented correctly, as breaking past suite
tests will have an effect on marking. Name your modified collection of new
tests Task3 TDD2.java (even if it is identical to the file you submitted as
Task3 TDD1.java in Part 1). Submit both the modified implementation
of Parser.java (rename it to Task3 Parser.java), and the test suite
Task3 TDD2.java.
