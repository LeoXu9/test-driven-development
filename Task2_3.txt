I had two approaches.

First is to reduce the number of tests. I noticed that there
were some test that were too redundant and did not contribute
to coverage increase. I decided to remove these tests.

Second is to get rid of the tests that takes too much memory
usage. I used run configuration -Xms2m. This command enables me
to limit the memory allocation resource for running the tests.
Now I only have 2m memory allocation. However, I am still able to
run all the tests. Although this is a intuitive and objective way
to limit resource, it did not give me any result straight away.

Logically speaking, the tests that creates multiple array, lists, and
hashmap objects take the most memory. So I decided to get rid of
some tests that test the equals function. This way less objects
are created for the hashmap.

I have also removed all the tests contain replace, including bug12 and bug18.
This is because these created lots of arrays which can take lots of memory.
